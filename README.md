A sketching app similar to the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.

Learned:
* Sensor Manager - for controlling accelerometer

* Path object - used to process multiple touch events.
* Touch Events - detect touches and taps.

* Paint object
* Canvas object - to draw text, lines and circles.
* Bitmap object - represents the surface to be drawn on.

* DialogFragments - more than just alert dialogs. create custom DialogFragments for ColorDialogFragment, LineWidthDialogFragment, EraseImageDialogFragment. also note that we'll ensure that multiple dialogs don't appear on the screen at the same time.
